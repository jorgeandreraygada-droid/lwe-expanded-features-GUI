## 📖 About

**Linux Wallpaper Engine GUI** is a desktop application that provides an intuitive and feature-rich interface for managing and applying dynamic wallpapers on Linux systems. It leverages the power of [linux-wallpaperengine](https://github.com/Acters/linux-wallpaperengine) to bring the Wallpaper Engine experience to Linux users with additional GUI enhancements, organization tools, and automation features.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Debian, etc.)
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Display Server**: X11 (Wayland support through linux-wallpaperengine)

### System Dependencies
- `wmctrl` - Window management tool
- `xdotool` - X11 automation tool
- `python3-tk` - Tkinter GUI framework
- `python3-pil` or `python3-pillow` - Image processing library

### Backend Engine
- **[linux-wallpaperengine](https://github.com/Acters/linux-wallpaperengine)** - The core wallpaper engine
  - Install from: https://github.com/Acters/linux-wallpaperengine/tree/wayland-layer-cli
  - This is required to use wallpapers from Wallpaper Engine

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd linux-wallpaper-engine-features
chmod +x install.sh
# Interactive install (recommended)
./install.sh

# Non-interactive install without installing OS packages (e.g., in containers)
./install.sh --non-interactive --skip-system-deps

# Dry run to show actions without making changes
./install.sh --dry-run
```

The installer will:
1. Detect your package manager (apt, pacman, dnf, zypper)
2. Install required system dependencies (wmctrl, xdotool, python3-tk, python3-pillow) unless `--skip-system-deps` is passed
3. Create and/or activate a Python virtual environment (default: `.venv`)
4. Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
5. Set executable permissions on scripts and create application directories

Installer options:
- `--skip-system-deps` — Do not attempt to install OS packages (useful on minimal or locked-down systems)
- `--non-interactive` — Do not prompt for confirmation (assume yes where reasonable)
- `--dry-run` — Show the commands that would be executed without making changes
- `--venv-path <path>` — Create virtual environment at a custom path
- `--install-backend` — Try to clone the `linux-wallpaperengine` backend if it is not found (requires `git`)

Notes:
- `tkinter` is provided by your OS package manager; it is **not** installed via pip. On Debian/Ubuntu the package is `python3-tk`, on Fedora `python3-tkinter` etc.
- If the backend `linux-wallpaperengine` is not installed you can use `--install-backend` or follow the backend's README to install it manually.
- To reproduce the exact virtual environment used by the project maintainer, the repository includes `requirements.lock.txt` with pinned package versions; `install.sh` prefers this lockfile when present and will install those exact versions to create an identical `.venv`.

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd linux-wallpaper-engine-features
   ```

2. **Install system dependencies** (choose for your distro):

   **Ubuntu/Debian**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y wmctrl xdotool python3-tk python3-pil python3-venv
   ```

   **Arch Linux**:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm wmctrl xdotool tk python-pillow python-virtualenv
   ```

   **Fedora**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y wmctrl xdotool python3-tkinter python3-pillow python3-virtualenv
   ```

3. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set up backend**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x source/core/main.sh
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/linux-wallpaper-engine-features/
   ```

### Install linux-wallpaperengine Backend

The application requires the linux-wallpaperengine backend to function:

```bash
# Clone and install linux-wallpaperengine
git clone https://github.com/Acters/linux-wallpaperengine.git
cd linux-wallpaperengine
# Follow the installation instructions in their README
```

Ensure `linux-wallpaperengine` is installed and in your PATH.

## 📖 Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
./source/run.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
cd source
python3 GUI.py
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Set Wallpaper Directory**:
   - Click "PICK DIR" to select your Wallpaper Engine directory
   - Usually located at: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/`
   - Or your custom wallpaper collection directory

2. **Browse Wallpapers**:
   - Thumbnails will load automatically
   - Scroll through the gallery to preview available wallpapers

3. **Apply a Wallpaper**:
   - Click on any thumbnail to apply it immediately
   - The wallpaper will start running

4. **Organize with Groups**:
   - Use the group selection to filter wallpapers by category
   - Create custom groups for easier navigation

5. **Use Random Mode**:
   - Check "random mode" to enable automatic rotation
   - Set the interval (delay) between changes
   - The application will cycle through available wallpapers

6. **Configure Options**:
   - **Window Mode**: Run wallpapers as actual windows
   - **Remove Above Priority**: Remove always-on-top behavior (recommended)
   - **Show Logs**: View real-time application logs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure all system dependencies are installed
- Check that the virtual environment is activated
- Verify Python version is 3.10+

### Wallpapers not appearing
- Ensure linux-wallpaperengine is installed and in PATH
- Verify the wallpaper directory is correctly set
- Check that wallpaper folders contain `preview.jpg` or `preview.png`

### Wallpaper won't apply
- Test with `linux-wallpaperengine` directly
- Check logs in `~/.local/share/linux-wallpaper-engine-features/logs.txt`
- Verify your display manager compatibility

### Random/Delay mode not stopping
- The process should stop automatically; check the logs
- If stuck, kill manually: `pkill -f linux-wallpaperengine`

---

## 📝 Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/linux-wallpaper-engine-features/config.json`. You can manually edit this file to adjust settings:

- `--dir` - Wallpaper directory path
- `--window` - Window mode settings
- `--above` - Always-on-top flag
- `--random` - Random mode enabled
- `--delay` - Auto-change delay settings
- `--show-logs` - Log visibility
